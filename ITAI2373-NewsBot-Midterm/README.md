# 📰 NewsBot Intelligence System

Welcome to the **NewsBot Intelligence System**, my mid-term NLP group project! This end-to-end system showcases my mastery of all techniques from **Modules 1–8**, including preprocessing, classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition — applied to real-world news articles.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project challenged me and my team to build an integrated **News Intelligence System** that processes, categorizes, and extracts insights from a dataset of news articles. We collaboratively applied advanced NLP techniques to solve real-world problems using Python and industry-standard tools.

> **Project Duration**: 1 Week  
> **Recommended Time**: ~15–20 hours per team  
> **Dataset**: [BBC News Classification Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc/data)

## ⭐ Why This Project Matters

News intelligence powers applications like:
- Google News article categorization
- Financial market sentiment monitoring
- Media company competitor tracking
- Public opinion research for policy-making

By building this system, we gained experience with an industrial-strength NLP pipeline and understood how natural language can drive business value.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, we were able to:

- ✅ Integrate and apply **Modules 1–8** into a complete system  
- ✅ Design a full **text processing pipeline**  
- ✅ Build and compare **text classification models**  
- ✅ Perform **sentiment and emotion analysis**  
- ✅ Extract and analyze **named entities** and **syntactic patterns**  
- ✅ Translate technical output into **business insights**  
- ✅ Work collaboratively using **professional development tools**  
- ✅ Document and present findings to **technical and non-technical** audiences

## 📖 Core System Components (Modules 1–8)

Each of the following modules were included in our system:

### **Module 1: Real-World NLP Application Context**
- Define a business use case
- Identify industry and target users
- Explain real-world value and application

### **Module 2: Text Preprocessing Pipeline**
- Cleaning and normalization
- Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
- Handle formatting and text edge cases

### **Module 3: TF-IDF Feature Extraction**
- Apply `TfidfVectorizer` with optimization
- Visualize top terms per category
- Analyze feature importance

### **Module 4: Part-of-Speech (POS) Pattern Analysis**
- POS tagging and pattern extraction
- Cross-category POS distribution
- Identify writing style differences

### **Module 5: Syntax Parsing & Semantic Role Analysis**
- Use dependency parsing to extract relations
- Engineer syntactic features
- Optional: Semantic role labeling (SRL)

### **Module 6: Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**
- Sentiment classification (e.g., VADER, TextBlob)
- Emotional tone detection and analysis
- Visualize sentiment across categories

### **Module 7: Multi-Class Text Classification**
- Implement classifiers (LogReg, NB, SVM, etc.)
- Tune models, compare performance
- Use cross-validation and confusion matrices

### **Module 8: Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- Extract PERSON, ORG, GPE, DATE, MONEY
- Analyze entity frequency and co-occurrence
- Cross-category entity patterns
