## ITAI 2373 - Natural Language Processing

## Lab Overview

This notebook explores Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, a fundamental Natural Language Processing task. It covers basic concepts, practical application using NLTK and SpaCy, handling real-world "messy" text, and analyzing customer service transcripts.

## Setup and Installation

To run this notebook, you will need to install the following libraries:
```bash
!pip install nltk spacy matplotlib seaborn pandas
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
